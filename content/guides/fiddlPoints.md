Fiddl Points are the currency of Fiddl.Art. They’re used for creating , collecting, and enjoying artwork on the platform.

## How to Get Fiddl Points
**Buy Them:** Visit the [Add Points](https://fiddl.art/addPoints) page, choose a package, and pay with PayPal or credit card. More payment options are coming soon. Larger packages offer bulk discounts.

**Sell Your Art:** When someone purchases your public creations, you earn Fiddl Points as commission. The more popular your art, the more points you could earn.

**Refer Others:** Share your referral link from the [Settings](https://fiddl.art/settings) page or just share your public profile. When new members join and buy points, you earn bonuses.

## How Can You Spend Your Fiddl Points?

### Create Images
Transform your ideas into art. Each AI model charges a different rate depending on its complexity. When creating an image you can specify the model, the prompt, aspect ratio, and quantity. Behind the scenes a random number or "seed" is generated for each image which determines the final result. You can also adjust the seed manually to fine tune slight variations of a particular result.

### Improve Your Ideas
Use the AI assistant to brainstorm or refine concepts. For a small fee, get a fresh idea or polish your existing prompt. We offer three options: **New Idea** to randomly generate a fresh idea, **Randomize** to shuffle some aspects of your existing prompt, and **Improve** to get a more detailed and creative version of your prompt. It's a good idea to start with simple prompts until you find something interesting, then you can use the **Improve** option to refine it further and also test out the more expensive models.

### Train Your Own Model
Use Face Forge to teach the AI to recognize your face and include it in your creations. This process requires a points fee. Learn more in our [Face Forge blog post](/guides/faceforge).

### Purchase Existing Art
Love someone else’s work? Use points to purchase the image which unlocks:
- The original prompt and model details, enabling you to create similar art easily
- The original source art, plus a 4K upscaled version available to download
- The option to like, save, and showcase it on your profile
- The ability to use it as your avatar
- Future options will include things like unlocking physical prints and merchandise

In short, Fiddl Points help you create, improve, personalize, and collect art on the platform.


## The Future of Fiddl Points
Soon, you’ll be able to redeem Fiddl Points outside the platform and even use them to buy physical prints and merchandise. We are committed to ensuring that all future features of the platform will be accessible with Fiddl Points.
