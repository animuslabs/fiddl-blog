Face Forge lets you bring your own likeness into the images you create on Fiddl.Art. By uploading a series of clear photos, you can train a model that reflects your appearance. Once training finishes, you’ll be able to use your personalized model just like any other on the create page. You can also adjust privacy settings on the Face Forge page, letting others generate images with your model if you’d like.

## Guide

### Choosing Your Photos
**Quality is key.** Provide at least 10 clear images of your face from various angles. Avoid group shots or extreme side profiles. Mixing up lighting, poses, and expressions can help produce more natural, versatile results.

### Training Modes
- **Normal Mode:** A solid starting point, offering good results without much effort.
- **Advanced Mode:** Delivers more detail and nuance, but may require experimenting with more specific prompts.

Training typically takes 15-30 minutes. Once it’s done, you’ll be directed to the create page to start using your new model.

### Prompting Tips
Be clear that your face should stand out. For example, instead of “someone riding a horse,” try “a cinematic close-up of a man’s face as he rides a horse.” Including details like gender, age, setting, and lighting can lead to more accurate results.

## Prompt Templates

### Professional Headshot
    A sharp, well-lit headshot showing a confident [man’s/woman’s] face, wearing professional attire.

### Superhero
    A strong, heroic face staring boldly ahead, framed by a flowing cape and a glowing city skyline.

### Wizard
    A wise-looking face with subtle wrinkles, illuminated by candlelight in an ancient library.

### Viking
    A rugged face with intense eyes, framed by a horned helmet against a backdrop of snowy mountains.

### Soldier
    A determined face under a helmet, illuminated by distant firelight on a misty battlefield.

### Princess
    A graceful face in soft, royal lighting, wearing a delicate tiara in a grand hall.

### Athlete
    A focused face beaded with sweat, set against bright stadium lights.

Feel free to experiment, and once you’ve created something you’re proud of, share it on social media with #fiddlart.
