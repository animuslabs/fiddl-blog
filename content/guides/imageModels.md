## What are AI Image Models?
An AI image model is a type of neural network software inspired by the human brain. The software is "trained" on millions of images using vast amounts of computing power and specialized hardware. By learning patterns from this massive dataset, it can understand, recognize, and generate images in various styles. On Fiddl.art, you can choose from multiple models, each with its own unique capabilities. Some models are more expensive to utilize because theyâ€™re more complex and require more processing power to operate. Today we support seven models and are constantly working to add more.


## Models available on Fiddl.Art
For each model I will provide an example render using the prompt:
```
A close-up shot of a radiant individual with an expressive face in a vibrant solarpunk city, showcasing their joyful demeanor while they engage in daily activities. The scene vividly portrays a stunning utopian landscape, with innovative, eco-friendly architecture that harmoniously integrates lush greenery, solar panels, and serene water features. The warm, cinematic lighting adds a golden glow that enhances the beauty of the setting. Surrounding them, diverse citizens wear clothing crafted from organic, natural fabrics in earthy tones, reflecting the deep connection between humanity and nature. The lively atmosphere is pulsating with community spirit, highlighted by families congregating, children joyously playing, and public art embellishing the urban environment with striking murals depicting local flora and fauna. Delicate birds and colorful butterflies dance through the air, breathing life into the scene. Streets are adorned with vertical gardens and flourishing trees, epitomizing the sustainable, optimistic future for humanity while invoking a sense of hope and togetherness.
```
I used the same prompt for each model, but keep in mind that each model has its own strengths and weaknesses, and may perform better or worse with different prompts.

### Stable Diffusion 3.5
Created by the Stability.ai team, this is the latest version of their open source model.
